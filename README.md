# rqt_topic_display

Currently this displays text from a String topic, a scroll bar will appear as needed.
(Though this limits the minimum size of the widget)
There is an accumulate service that switches to a mode where the messages accumulate.

Eventually view a config file defined list of topic/topic-subfield values to display,
with support for any message type.
